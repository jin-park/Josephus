# Josephus
This repository contains a circular linked list implementation and a solution to the Josephus problem

# Naming Scheme

Functions that are accessable to the user are named like this:
append, remove, etc
<br>The functions that actually do the work are named like this:
_append, _remove, _remove_index, etc

# Bash Files

The files run.sh and j.sh are bash files that will compile main.cpp and Josephus.cpp for you so you don't have to write stuff like g++ main.cpp all the time

# Don't have an ide or a text editor? No problem
